The problem came with many soldiers attempting to fire full auto, and then by the third or fourth shot they would be entirely missing their target. The training was made around turning an impractical 40's weapon practical haha. The British L1A1 was much the same, though made with only single-fire in mind, though it could be tweaked for full-auto if you really wanted to"/>

The problem came with many soldiers attempting to fire full auto, and then by the third or fourth shot they would be entirely missing their target. The training was made around turning an impractical 40's weapon practical haha.
